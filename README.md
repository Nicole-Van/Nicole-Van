## About Me
Hello I'm Nikki, a curious and detail-driven data analyst with a background that blends tech, customer service, and team leadership. I helped support the Autopilot and Optimus teams for Tesla by labeling audio and visual data to train self-driving auto and robotics systems. This sharpened my eye for detail and gave me a deeper appreciation for how data shapes the future of technology.I love learning new things, jumping into new challenges, and working with teams to make great things happen.
## Education
I received my Associates of Science in data analytics from Wilmington University in the data analytics program. My plan is to continue forward to my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in AI, graduating August 2026.
