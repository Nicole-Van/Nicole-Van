## About Me
Hello I'm Nikki, a curious and detail-driven data analyst with a background that blends tech, customer service, and team leadership.

This sharpened my eye for detail and gave me a deeper appreciation for how data shapes the future of technology.I love learning new things, jumping into new challenges, and working with teams to make great things happen.
